# AzureTopologyDiagrammer
A Powershell-based Visio diagrammer for Azure environments. Currently tested in Azure PowerShell module 0.9.1 and Visio 2016.

This initial version diagrams Azure regions and resource groups. Azure Networks and Subnets coming in the next iteration. The goal of opening up this project is to encourage others to help build this into a great community solution, as I've been too hampered by time to get it to where it needs to be.
