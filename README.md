# AzureTopologyDiagrammer
A Powershell-based Visio diagrammer for Azure environments. Currently tested in Azure PowerShell module 0.9.1 and Visio 2016. The goal of opening up this project is to encourage others to help build this into a great community solution, as I've been too hampered by time to get it to where it needs to be.

This initial version diagrams Azure regions and resource groups (with networking and subnets coming shortly).
